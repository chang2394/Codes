COMBINATORICS

generate all permutations
generate all subsets
generate all n-tuples
generate all multisets
generate all partitions
generate all set partitions

generate all subsets of submask

return next/previous (combinatorial structure of some kind)
- permutation, subset, n-tuple, partition, k-partition, k-subset, etc

evaluate binomial
evaluate multinomial

lucas' theorem

rank/unrank (combinatorial structure)
- see next/previous

COMPUTATIONAL-GEOMETRY

ccw
polygon-polygon intersection
convex hull with collinear points in O(n log n)
point in polygon that handles edge cases
point in convex polygon in O(log N)
distance from point to line, line segment, circle, polygon etc
projection of point to line (2d), plane (3d)

DATA STRUCTURE

- range minimum query in <O(n),O(log n)>, update O(log n), range update (as
  fast as possible) http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Segment_tree
- interval tree (to represent union of intervals)
- range minimum query in <O(n),O(1)> http://wcipeg.com/wiki/RMQ
- binomial heap
- fibonacci heap
- avl tree with order statistics
- splay tree
- aa tree
- scapegoat tree
- treap
- b-tree?

GRAPH

- mincost maxflow with dijkstra (potensials)
- maxflow with dinic's algorithm
- bipartite matching with capacity >1 between each pairs such that
  the array g[][]>1 (supporting multiple of each item on each side)
- bipartite matching with edge weights=1, but where one of the sides can be
  chosen >1 times, should be faster and should use less memory than
  maxflow-tripartite
- find bridge in graph: edge that splits graph if removed
  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bridge_%28graph_theory%29

- find all k-articulation points or k-bridges: all k-tuples of (nodes, edges)
  that disconnects the graph when removed
- dilworth's theorem (minimum number of chains in a DAG or something like that)
- kth shortest path
- tarjan's scc
- feasible flow (maxflow with min/max capacity per edge)
- multicommodity flow
- out-of-kilter algorithm (but only if it isn't dominated by mincost maxflow
  with dijkstra)
- proper polynomial-time mincost maxflow
- dijkstra running in O(V log V+E) (is it of any use? consider another data
  structure than heap, for example skip-list)
- bron-kerbosch for max-clique: add vertex ordering
- online algorithms in general are strongly desired!
  - find articulation points (fast) in a graph where we add AND remove nodes
    and edges

MATRIX

- matadd
- determinant
- inverse
- gaussian elimination
- gaussian elimination mod
- for square matrix A, sum A^1+A^2+...+A^n (not hard to deduce, though)
